# The-Ultimate-Personality-Pet-Finder

In this project the goal was to use the skills we have practiced in class and out to put together a working website that uses APIs in a functional way.  We used the petfinder API which caused us trouble at the beginning and we were grateful to have gotten it to work with some help. We also used a location API to source adoption centers near the users location. The website works by taking in a few data pieces by using a quiz, and then using the location of the user finds dogs and cats available for adoption in their area.  If I could improve a few things it would be the design of the website I would like to have  streamlined things better visually, I would  also dig into the API to see if we could get Canada locations working somehow. Currently it only works using locations in the US as far as we know. I'm very happy we ended up being able to use this idea and that it ended up working.
